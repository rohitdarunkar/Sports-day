# Sports Day Callback Project 🏅

A simple JavaScript project that simulates a Sports Day event using callback functions, asynchronous execution, and user interaction.

🔗 Live Demo: https://sports-day.pages.dev/

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how callback functions can be used to execute tasks sequentially.  
It simulates a sports day with multiple events and calculates scores dynamically.

The events include:
- Opening Ceremony  
- 100M Race  
- Long Jump  
- High Jump  
- Award Ceremony  

All events run in sequence using JavaScript callbacks.

## Features

- Uses `setInterval` and `setTimeout` for asynchronous behavior  
- Generates random race results  
- Takes user input using `prompt()`  
- Updates and displays scores after every event  
- Declares final winners based on scores  

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Callbacks & Async)

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Open the browser console (F12)
4. Click **Start Sports Day**
